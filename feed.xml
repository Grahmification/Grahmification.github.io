It offers significant productivity gains in the field of motion control with almost no cost. Sound too good to be true? Surpringly, input shaping is a topic that gets very little attention. As of writing this article, the Wikipedia Page on input shaping has a mere single paragraph explanation. I’ve already written a relatively detailed art... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Ultra Precision Vertical Stage Series</title><link href="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/magnetic-counterbalance-stages/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ultra Precision Vertical Stage Series" /><published>2022-04-01T15:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2022-04-01T15:00:00-07:00</updated> <id>https://grahmification.github.io/posts/magnetic-counterbalance-stages/</id> <content src="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/magnetic-counterbalance-stages/" /> <author> <name>Graham Kerr</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <category term="Zaber" /> <summary> The LDA-AEZ and LDM-AEZ series of ultra-precision vertical stages fill out the Zaber’s direct drive product lineups with vertical axis options. I oversaw the design and launch of these products from the working prototype phase into a polished mass production ready design. The vertical stages are available in two family sizes: the LDA and LDM Background These stages are particularly exciti... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>3D Printed Casts</title><link href="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/3d-printed-hand-cast/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="3D Printed Casts" /><published>2022-01-28T14:00:00-08:00</published> <updated>2022-01-28T14:00:00-08:00</updated> <id>https://grahmification.github.io/posts/3d-printed-hand-cast/</id> <content src="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/3d-printed-hand-cast/" /> <author> <name>Graham Kerr</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <category term="Hobby" /> <summary> In 2022 I had hand surgery to repair a torn ligament. The healing process required wearing a hand splint for a few months. The splint made by the occupational therapist was annoyingly bulky, and this sparked the idea of trying to make a better custom splint with a 3D printer. The original hand splint. Not bad, but the rib along the right side is annoying. The following writeup details my a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Tensegrity Structures</title><link href="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/tensegrity-structure/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tensegrity Structures" /><published>2021-12-15T14:00:00-08:00</published> <updated>2021-12-15T14:00:00-08:00</updated> <id>https://grahmification.github.io/posts/tensegrity-structure/</id> <content src="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/tensegrity-structure/" /> <author> <name>Graham Kerr</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <category term="Hobby" /> <summary> I had previously 3D printed a tensegrity structure, and thought it would be fun to machine a couple as Christmas presents for my parents. The 3D printed ones are a little flimsy, but I figured steel cables would make these much stiffer. Design The design was reasonably straightforward. All the parts were to be made from 6061-T6 aluminum to keep machining simple. I wanted the structure to comf... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>ADR Linear Motor XY Microscope Stage Series</title><link href="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/adr-linear-motor-microscope-stage/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ADR Linear Motor XY Microscope Stage Series" /><published>2021-07-01T15:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2025-02-02T12:53:46-08:00</updated> <id>https://grahmification.github.io/posts/adr-linear-motor-microscope-stage/</id> <content src="https://grahmification.github.io/posts/adr-linear-motor-microscope-stage/" /> <author> <name>Graham Kerr</name> </author> <category term="Projects" /> <category term="Zaber" /> <summary> The ADR series of linear motor XY microscope stages is one of the most application specific products I’ve developed. The goal of this project was to design the best stage in the world for 24/7 high throughput imaging with a form factor that can be mounted to conventional inverted microscopes from “the big 4”. Primary goals were to provide similar baseline functionality to the existing ASR seri... </summary> </entry> </feed>
