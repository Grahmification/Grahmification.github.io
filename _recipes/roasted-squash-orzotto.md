directions:
- Preheat the oven to 450°F.
- In a bowl, toss the squash with some oil, salt & pepper, and 1/3 of the spice mix. Spread on a tinfoil lined baking sheet.
- Bake the squash at 450°F for 15-18 mins, turning half-way, until brown and tender.
- Meanwhile, heat some oil in a medium pot and saute the garlic for approx 30-60s until fragrant. 
- Add the orzo pasta, 1 cup water, 2 cups chicken broth, and the rest of the spice mix to the pot. Be careful adding the water to the heated oil.
- Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10-12 mins, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed and the pasta is al dente.
- Add the grated cheese, butter, green onion, and some salt/pepper to the pasta. Stir and cook for 1-2mins until the cheese is melted and combined.
- If the orzotto is too dry, gradually add up to 1/2 cup water, stirring constantly, until desired consistency is achieved.
- Serve with the squash on top.

Extremely good. Goes well with a side salad of baby greens. The original recipe calls for 4 Tbsp butter, and lemon powder + dried black olives in the spice mix. It also calls for 30g vegetable demi-glace, but replacing it with the chicken broth is much simpler and works well.
