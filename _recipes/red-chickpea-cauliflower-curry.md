ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
- 1/3 Cup Shallot or Onion - Chopped
- 4 Cloves Garlic - Minced
- 2 Tbsp Fresh Ginger - Minced
- 1 Jalapeno Pepper - Chopped
- 4 Tbsp Red Curry Paste
- 2 Cups (500ml) Light Coconut Milk
- 1 Tsp Turmeric
- 1 Tbsp Maple Syrup
- 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce
- 1 Cup Cauliflower (Approx 1 head) - Chopped
- 1 1/4 Cup Cooked Chickpeas (or 500ml can)
- 1/2 Cup Peanuts
- 2 Cups Rice

optional_ingredients:
- Green or red onion - Chopped
- Sesame Seeds

directions:
- Heat a large frying pan or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add water or vegetable oil, shallot, garlic, ginger, and jalapeno. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.
- Add curry paste and stir. Cook for 2 minutes more. Add coconut milk, turmeric, maple syrup, soy sauce, and stir. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
- Once simmering, add cauliflower and chickpeas and slightly reduce heat. You want a simmer, not a boil, which should be around low to medium-low heat.
- Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to soften the cauliflower and chickpeas and infuse them with curry flavor. Keep at a simmer – lower heat if boiling.
- Stir in peanuts. Taste and adjust the flavor of the broth as needed. Add more syrup for sweetness, soy sauce for saltiness, and turmeric for earthiness. You can also add more curry paste for more spice and intense curry flavor. Don’t be shy with seasonings – this curry should be very flavorful.
- Serve as is, or over rice, quinoa, or greens (optional). Garnish with desired toppings such as sesame seeds, cilantro, lime, or diced red onion (optional).
