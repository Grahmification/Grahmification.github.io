ingredients:
- 1 Large head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets
- 2 Tsp Garlic powder
- 1/4 Tsp Salt
- 1/4 Tsp Black pepper
- 1 Tbsp Butter, melted (or replace w/ coconut oil)
- 1/2 to 3/4 cup Frank's Buffalo Wing Style hot sauce or other hot wing sauce of choice
- Large Ziplock bag

optional_ingredients:
- Ranch or blue cheese dip
- Celery or carrot sticks to accompany

directions:
- Preheat oven to 450F degrees.
- Place cauliflower florets into plastic bag. Drizzle olive oil over florets to barely coat.
- Add garlic powder, salt and pepper. Close bag and toss ingredients around so all florets are coated.
- Place on ungreased cookie sheet or baking pan and bake on middle rack for 15 minutes, turning florets once during baking. Check them at the 10 minute mark for desired tenderness. You don't want them to be soggy!
- Remove florets from oven. Melt the butter in small glass bowl, add the hot sauce, then pour it into the Ziplock bag. Toss cauliflower to cover all florets with hot sauce. Start with about half the sauce and add more to your taste.
- Return to oven and cook for additional 5 minutes.
- Serve with any dip you like, ranch dressing or Blue Cheese dip.
