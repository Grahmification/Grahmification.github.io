ingredients:
- 1.5 Tbsp Olive Oil
- 1 Large Onion, diced
- 4 Garlic Cloves, minced
- 1 Tsp Oregano
- 1 Tsp Thyme (or use more oregano)
- 1.5 Tsp Kosher Salt, plus more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 5.5oz/155ml Can Tomato Paste
- 3 Cups (710ml) Vegetable Broth
- 1 Cup Red Lentils
- 1/4 Cup Walnuts or Pecans, finely crushed
- 14oz/415ml Can Crushed Tomatoes
- 454g Long, Wide Pasta or Penne
- 1 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar, or 1-2 Tsp Brown Sugar

optional_ingredients:
- 1/2 Cup Dry Red Wine
- Fresh Parsley or Basil, Chopped

directions:
- Soak the 1 cup of lentils in water for 30 minutes, max 60 minutes. Meanwhile, prep all the other ingredients (chop onions, garlic, walnuts, etc.).
- Heat a large pot on medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, and once it’s shimmering, add the onions and a pinch of salt. 
- Stir occasionally and cook the onions until a light brown fond starts form on the surface of the pan, about 5 minutes. Add a few spoons of water to deglaze the pan, and stir. Continue cooking the onions, adding more water every few minutes and stirring frequently, until the onions are softened and golden brown, 9-10 minutes.
- Add the garlic, thyme, oregano, 1.5 tsp kosher salt, and pepper to taste. Stir frequently and cook for 60-90 seconds.
- Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2-3 minutes to caramelize, stirring very frequently, until it’s dark red in color.
- Optional - If using red wine, pour into the pan and deglaze, scraping up any browned bits. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the smell of alcohol has burned off and the mixture is jammy.
- Pour in the broth and deglaze the pan. Add the lentils and walnuts, and stir everything to incorporate. 
- Heat until the mixture comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and maintain a rapid simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for another 15-20 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still al dente. Stir occasionally to prevent burning/sticking.
- Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta.
- Taste the bolognese for seasonings, adding more salt and pepper to taste. Finish with the balsamic vinegar or sugar, and stir to combine.
- Optional - Garnish with chopped parsley or basil.

Probably my favorite vegetarian pasta dish. Make sure to cook the onions long enough - it will seem like too long at first.
