ingredients:
- 1-2 Tbsp Neutral Vegetable Oil
- 2 White Onions, Diced
- 4 Cloved Garlic, Minced
- 2 Tsp Ginger, Minced
- 1 Tsp Turmeric
- 1 Tsp Ground Coriander
- 1 Tsp Cumin
- 1 Tsp Paprika
- 1 Tsp Garam Masala or Curry Powder
- 1.75 Cups Dry Red Lentils
- 3.25 Cups Vegetable Broth
- 1 Cup Coconut Milk
- Salt & Pepper To Taste
- 2 Tbsp Lime or Lemon Juice

optional_ingredients:
- 1 Can (500ml) Diced Tomatoes, Strained
- Sesame Seeds
- Chopped Peanuts
- Fresh Parsley

directions:
- Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the chopped onions, and sauté for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and ginger. Sauté for another minute until fragrant. 
- Add the spices and sauté for a few seconds to unfold flavors.
- Rinse the lentils in a fine-mashed sieve with cold water. Add them to the onion mixture in the skillet. Pour in the vegetable broth, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. Cook covered for 8-10 minutes, or until the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid.
- Add the coconut milk and strained tomatoes (if using) and simmer another 5-10 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth or coconut milk until the desired consistency is reached.
- Season with salt, pepper, and lime juice to taste.
- Garnish your dahl with sesame seeds, peanuts, fresh chopped parsley, or other toppings you like. Serve over rice or with homemade vegan naan or aloo paratha.

A delicious simple meal. The tomatoes sound odd but are actually quite fitting. Serve with rice. Could also be good to try adding chickpeas or black beans.
