ingredients:
- 4 Large tortillas, flour or tomato
- 3-4 Jalapenos, finely diced
- 250g Cream cheese, room temperature
- 1 Cup cheddar cheese, grated
- 1 Cup bacon, cooked & diced

optional_ingredients:

directions:
- Cook the bacon. While cooking, dice the jalapenos and shred the cheese. Remove as many seeds from the jalapenos as possible.
- In a mixing bowl stir cream cheese until smooth.
- Add diced jalapenos, diced bacon, and grated cheese. Stir until combined.
- Set tortillas on the countertop. Divide cream cheese mixture into fourths and spoon onto tortilla shells. If you have too much cream cheese mixture you can always make another roll-up. The recipe makes around 4.
- Spread cream cheese mixture to edges of tortillas and roll them up tightly.
- Wrap each tortilla in tightly in plastic wrap.
- Refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight. Can put in the freezer for a bit to speed this up.
- Trim the ends off the roll-ups. Then cut into 1 inch slices.
- Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two days.
- <b>Optional:</b> Put on a tinfoil covered baking sheet and broil for 5 minutes in the oven before serving.

Great for parties, and super easy. Can serve cold, but even better if broiled for 5 mins in the oven. Bring them to the party cold, then cut up on the spot. It's important to have the cream cheese at room temperature or it won't spread well.
