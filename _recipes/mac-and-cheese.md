ingredients:
- 450g Macaroni or Curly Elbow Noodles
- 1 lb Bacon
- 1-2 Jalapenos, Diced
- 2 Shallots, Sliced
- 3-4 Cups Marble or Cheddar Cheese, Shredded
- 1 Cup Bread Crumbs (Reduce salt if bread crumbs are seasoned)
- 0.25-0.5 lb butter
- 500mL 2% Milk (or 10% Cream), Warmed in microwave. Increase if there is more pasta.
- 0.5-1 Cup Flour
- Salt and Pepper To Taste

optional_ingredients:

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350F.
- Cook the bacon in a frying pan. Remove the grease and dice it up.
- Cook the pasta in salted water. Undercook pasta by about 1 minute. Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.
- Peel and thinly slice the shallots. Also dice the jalapenos (keep seeds if desired).
- Melt the butter in large saucepan on medium heat.
- Gradually add in small amounts of flour (don't need to use it all). Keep on heat for about 2 minutes and continue whisking. The mixture will darken slightly. Add pepper to taste and salt if desired.
- Slowly add warmed milk to the mixture. Keep whisking, the mixture will thicken. Add in more milk if too thick. 2 minutes total time. 
- Slowly add in 2-3 cups of shredded cheese. Keep stirring with heat on medium for another 2 minutes. Stir well with a spoon (whisk is too weak).
- Lower heat. Add in cooked pasta, shallots, bacon and jalapenos. Stir until well mixed then remove from heat.
- Pour the mixture into a deep oven safe dish. Spread into an even layer and form ridges on top if desired (will brown in oven). Add pepper and salt if desired. Top with bread crumbs, remaining shredded cheese, extra sliced jalepenos.
- Cook in the oven at 350F for 25-40 minutes, until the cheese has melted and sauce bubbling, golden brown on top. Broil at the end to crisp up the top crumbs.
- Remove from oven and let sit for ~15 minutes to cool.

Mac and cheese that only somewhat feels like you're going to have a heart attack (but worth it). Ideally cook in a non-stick baking pan. The outside will form a hard crust and hold everything together.
