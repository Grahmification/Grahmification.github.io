Easy and tasty meatball dish. Serve with rice and vegetables of your choice. Works best for fairly large meatballs so they don't dry out. 

Note: These are delicate since they don't include breadcrumbs. You can add some breadcrumbs in if you want to stretch your meat a little further, they will still be delicious.
