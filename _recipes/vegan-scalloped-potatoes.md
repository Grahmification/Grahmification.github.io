ingredients:
- 8-10 Russet Potatoes (~3lb)
- 1 Onion, Diced
- <b><u>Sauce:</u></b>
- 1.5 Cups Raw Cashews
- 2 Cups Unsweetened Almond Milk
- 0.5 Cups Nutritional Yeast
- 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder
- 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice
- 1 Tsp Salt

optional_ingredients:
- Fresh Parsley for topping

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees
- Boil cashews for 5-10 minutes then drain and set aside.
- Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Once skillet is ready, add diced onions along with a little water, if needed, to prevent sticking. Cook until the onions are “soft.” Remove pan from heat and set aside.
- Peel and thinly slice the potatoes evenly as possible.  It's important to get them as even as possible.
- Add all sauce ingredients to blender. Process until “cheese” sauce is completely smooth. Pour cheese sauce into mixing bowl, add the cooked onions and stir to combine.
- Pour ¼ cup of the cheese sauce onto the bottom of the baking dish and evenly spread.
- Layer ½ the potatoes in the baking dish and pour ½ the creamy sauce over the potatoes. Add the remaining potatoes and top with the rest of the sauce.
- Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 20 minutes or until the top of potatoes are brown and sauce is bubbling. The potatoes should be tender enough to easily pierce with a fork.
- Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes before eating. Top with fresh parsley if desired.

I've gotten lots of comments that people prefer this to regular scalloped potatoes with cheese.
