ingredients:
- 3-4 Eggs
- 1/2 White Onion, Chopped
- 1/2 Red Pepper, Chopped
- 1/2 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
- 1/2 Tbsp Butter

optional_ingredients:

directions:
- Heat a frying pan on medium heat. Cook the onion and red pepper in vegetable oil.
- Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a bowl. Add chili powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Stir the mixture with a fork until the yolks are broken up and the spices are evenly mixed in.
- When the onions and pepper are soft, pour them into the bowl with the eggs. Mix everything together with a fork.
- Butter the frying pan. Leave it on medium heat until the whole bottom is covered with melted butter. This is important to prevent the omelette from sticking. 
- Pour the egg mixture into the frying pan. Use a spatula to distribute it as evenly as possible over the whole pan.
- As the omelette begins to cook, push in the edges a bit with a spatula. Tip the frying pan so the uncooked egg flows to the edges.
- After a few minutes, sprinkle the chili pepper flakes on the omelette, and then fold it in half with a spatula. Press down on the folded omelette to help flatten it and cook for a few more minutes.
- Cut in half and top with Salsa for serving.

One of my own creations I've slowly been perfecting. Cut up the remaining half onion/pepper for a super easy second breakfast.
