ingredients:
- 1 lb Brussels Sprouts, Trimmed and Halved
- 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
- 1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt
- 1/4 Tsp Black Pepper
- 1 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar
- 1-2 Tbsp Pecans

optional_ingredients:
- Handful of Parmesan Cheese

directions:
- Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium high for 4 minutes. Add the oil. As soon as the oil is hot and shining (but before it starts smoking), swirl to cost the pan, then add the halved Brussels sprouts. Shake the skillet a little and prod them so that as many as possible are cut-side down. Let sit completely undisturbed for 5 to 8 minutes, until they develop a dark, caramelized sear.
- Add the salt and pepper. Stir the Brussels sprouts with a spatula. Continue cooking, stirring every few minutes, until the Brussels sprouts are browned all over and just turning tender the inside, about 6 to 8 additional minutes.
- Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the vinegar, then the pecans. Let the residual heat of the skillet toast the nuts, stirring them very often so that they toast evenly on all sides and do not burn (if they arenâ€™t toasting, return the skillet to low heat). As soon as the nuts are toasted, transfer the sprouts to a serving plate and sprinkle with cheese. Enjoy hot.
