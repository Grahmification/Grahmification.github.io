directions:
- Preheat oven to 400°F.

- Pour over pork chops and let marinade for about 2-3 hours (min 20 minutes).
- Heat the olive oil in a large stainless or cast iron skillet on medium high heat. Add pork chops, without marinade, and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side until they get a nice brown color.

A unique way to prepare pork chops. Similar to teriyaki sauce, but with a nice touch of heat. Pairs nicely with broccoli and rice. It's ideal to use thicker pork chops. I haven't experimented with marinating longer than 3 hours, but it might be excellent.
