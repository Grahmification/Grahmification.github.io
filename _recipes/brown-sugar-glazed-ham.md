ingredients:
- 4-5 kg Half Ham. Preferrably pre-cooked, bone-in, non-spiral-cut. The shank portion is easier to carve but apparently the butt portion tastes better.
- 1 can/bottle of Coke or Dr.Pepper (355-500ml)
- <u><b>The Glaze:</b></u>
- 4 Cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 Cup unsalted butter
- 1 Cup brown sugar
- 1/2 Cup honey
- 2 Tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1/4 Tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 Tsp ground cloves

optional_ingredients:

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325째F.
- Cover a deep baking tray with tinfoil for easy cleanup.
- Rinse the ham under the tap and put in the tray.
- Pour the can of coke over the ham, then cover it loosely with tinfoil. The coke in the tray will keep the ham moist while it cooks.
- Insert a thermometer through the foil into the center of the ham. Make sure it's not touching the bone.
- Put the ham in the oven. Cook for 15min/lb (typically around 2.5hrs).
- With 1 hour cooking time remaining, prep the glaze. Heat the butter in a small pot or saucepan over medium heat until golden browned.
- Add in the brown sugar, honey, mustard, cinnamon and cloves, stirring to mix together well until the brown sugar has completely dissolved, (about 2 minutes).
- Reduce heat to low and add the garlic. Allow it to become fragrant, cooking for a further minute or two until the glaze just begins to simmer.
- Set the glaze aside and let cool to lukewarm (it should be the consistency of room-temperature honey).
- With 30 minutes cooking time remaining, pull out the ham and increase the oven to 425째F.
- Remove the foil and brush 1/2 the glaze on the ham. Return to the oven and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.
- Remove and re-glaze.
- Bake for the last 15 mins. Target 140째F (60째C) internal temp.

Super easy and cheap way to feed 10-15 people. Note that the original recipe specifies a much shorter cooking time (1.25hrs) and 3 glazings 15 mins apart. I've never done this but recommend experimenting with it. The hams are pre-cooked so it's safe. Resting time is probably more important with a shorter cooking time.
